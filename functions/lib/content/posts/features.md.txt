# What Can You Do with SwiftAce?

[SwiftAce](https://swiftace.org) is an (upcoming) open-source platform for hosting online courses. It can be customized, white-labeled, and self-hosted on a custom domain. It intends to serve independent online educators looking to share their knowledge and expertise.

The features offered by SwiftAce can be categorized into the four sections:

1. **Developer** - Functionality available to developers responsible for deploying and managing a self-hosted version of SwiftAce.

2. **Administrator** - Functionality available to the site administration for setting up courses, managing learning material, enrollments, grading etc.

3. **Learner** - Functionality available to learners who browse, enroll, and take courses on the site.

4. **Miscellaneous** - Other features/functionality that doesn’t fit into one of the above categories.

As you can probably tell, a developer will typically also be an admin, and an admin will also have access to all learner features.
