# Building a JSX Runtime - Part 1

[JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup within a JavaScript file. It was first introduced by [React](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) and is now used by several web frameworks. JSX also lets you define custom reusable "components" <sup>[[1]](#note-1)</sup> and use them like HTML tags.

Here's an example of some JSX code in a React application ([see it live](https://playcode.io/2057322)):

```javascript
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div class="container">
      <Greeting name="World" />
      <p>Welcome to JSX</p>
    </div>
  );
}

createRoot(document.body).render(<App />);
```

We define a JSX component `Greeting` that accepts a "prop"<sup>[[2]](#note-2)</sup> `name` and creates an `h1` heading. Then, we define a component `App` that creates a `div` containing a `Greeting` and a paragraph. Finally, we "render"<sup>[[3]](#note-3)</sup> the `App` into the body of the HTML page.

## How JSX Works

While JSX looks like HTML, under the hood JSX "elements"<sup>[[4]](#note-4)</sup> are transformed into JavaScript objects. This transformation is done by a compiler/bundler like [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html), [ESBuild](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html), or [Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/jsx/). The code shown above is transformed into the following before execution:

```javascript
import { jsxs as _jsxs, jsx as _jsx } from "react/jsx-runtime";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

function Greeting({ name }) {
  return _jsxs("h1", { children: ["Hello, ", name, "!"] });
}

function App() {
  return _jsxs("div", {
    class: "container",
    children: [
      _jsx(Greeting, { name: "World" }),
      _jsx("p", { children: "Welcome to JSX" }),
    ],
  });
}

createRoot(document.body).render(_jsx(App, {}));
```

JSX tags are replaced with calls to the functions `_jsx` and `_jsxs` imported from a framework-specific "JSX runtime" <sup>[[5]](#note-5)</sup>. Both these functions accept three arguments:

1. `type`: The type (or name) of the element. Tag names starting with lowercase letters (e.g. `div` or `p`) represent raw HTML tags and are converted to strings, while tag names starting with uppercase letters (e.g. `Greeting` or `App`) represent components. 

2. `props`: Attributes passed to JSX tags are collected into an object of key-value pairs called `props`. Further, child tags are included in a special prop `children`. The `_jsx` function is used for zero or one child, while `_jsxs` is used for two or more children.

3. `key` (optional): The attribute `key` is not included in `props`. Rather, it is passed as a third argument to the function. It typically represents a unique identifier for an element in a list. It is used by React and other frameworks for efficient [rendering of lists](https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists). 

Objects created using a JSX runtime are turned into DOM nodes (in a browser) or HTML files (on a server) using a renderer. The `App` object created above using `react/jsx-runtime` is rendered into a browser's `document.body` using `createRoot` from `react-dom/client`.

## A Custom JSX Runtime

Let's implement a simple JSX runtime to transform JSX tags into plain JavaScript objects. Let's create a folder `customjsx` and add a file `jsx-runtime.js` in it with the following code:

```javascript
// customjsx/jsx-runtime.js

export function jsx(type, props, key = null) {
  return { type, props, key };
}

export const jsxs = jsx;
```

That's it! That's the entire JSX runtime. The function `jsx` returns an object containing the `type`, `props`, and `key` passed in as arguments, and `jsxs` does the same. Libraries like [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/react/src/jsx/ReactJSXElement.js#L381), [Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/blob/main/jsx-runtime/src/index.js#L29), or [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono/blob/main/src/jsx/dom/jsx-dev-runtime.ts#L9) use more sophisticated implementations to support specific features.

Next, let's create a file `app.jsx` containing some JSX code mixed in with JavaScript:

```javascript
// app.jsx

function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

console.log(
  <div class="container">
    <Greeting name="World" />
    <p>Welcome to JSX</p>
  </div>
);
```

We define a component `Greeting` and use it to create a `div` element containing a `Greeting` and a paragraph. We log the `div` element to the console for inspection.

## Configuration and Execution

We'll run `app.jsx` using [Deno](https://deno.com), a Node.js alternative with [built-in](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/jsx/) JSX support <sup>[[6]](#note-6)</sup>. To use our custom JSX runtime with Deno, let's create a file `deno.jsonc` with the following code:

```javascript
// deno.jsonc
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // Use a JSX runtime similar to React
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    // Import the runtime from a custom path
    "jsxImportSource": "./customjsx"
  },
  "imports": {
    // Add ".js" to the path while importing the runtime
    "./customjsx/jsx-runtime": "./customjsx/jsx-runtime.js"
  }
}
```

We can now execute the code (assuming we have already [installed](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/) Deno) by running the following command on a terminal (on Linux or macOS) or command prompt (on Windows): 

```bash
$ deno app.jsx
```

Executing the above command results in the following output:

```javascript
{
  type: "div",
  props: {
    class: "container",
    children: [
      { type: [Function: Greeting], props: { name: "World" }, key: null },
      { type: "p", props: { children: "Welcome to JSX" }, key: null }
    ]
  },
  key: null
}
```

The output is an object with the key `type` set to `"div"`, and `props` set to an object with keys `class` and `children`. The first child has `type` set to `Greeting` (our custom component) and a prop `name` set to `World`, while the second is a `p` tag with a text child.

## Next Steps

While our JSX runtime works as expected, it's not very useful without a renderer. In Part 2 of this series (coming soon), we'll create a renderer to turn the objects returned by `jsx` and `jsxs` into valid HTML markup and use it to generate & serve HTML pages from `app.jsx`. 

I hope you found this introduction to JSX runtimes useful. See you in the next part!

### Footnotes

1. <a id="note-1"></a> A **JSX component** is a self-contained, reusable piece of UI in JavaScript, defined as a [function or class](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components). It typically integrates structure, styling, and behavior in a single unit.

2. <a id="note-2"></a> **Props** (properties) are inputs that look like HTML attributes, [passed to](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component) a JSX component to enable customization, dynamic behavior, and data flow from parent nodes.

3. <a id="note-3"></a> [Rendering](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html#rendering-an-element-into-the-dom) is the process of converting JSX elements into DOM nodes in the browser or HTML strings on a server. Libraries like [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) can also render to mobile apps. 

4. <a id="note-4"></a> A JSX tag, together with its props and child tags, is called an **element**. Elements can be made up of simple HTML tags (e.g. `div`) or custom components (e.g. `Greeting`).

5. <a id="note-5"></a> The mechanism of "JSX runtimes" enables web frameworks to implement [different strategies](https://chatgpt.com/share/671b49d9-a238-800a-99cf-998d1df8ed24) for parsing and rendering JSX nodes while using the same familiar syntax.

6. <a id="note-6"></a> If you're using [TypeScript](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/typescript_getstarted.php) with Node.js, you can [configure](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#jsxImportSource) it using a `tsconfig.json` file. Similarly, ESBuild can be [configured](https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#using-jsx-without-react) via command line arguments or `tsconfig.json`.
