[SwiftAce](https://swiftace.org) is an (upcoming) open-source platform for hosting online courses. It can be customized, white-labeled, and self-hosted on a custom domain. It intends to serve independent online educators looking to share their knowledge and expertise.

SwiftAce can be thought of as a “[Discourse](https://discourse.org/)/[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) for Online Courses” or an “Open-source [Teachable Alternative](https://alternativeto.net/software/teachable/).” SwiftAce is currently under active development and is **NOT** ready for alpha/beta/production use. 

The source code is hosted on GitHub at [https://github.com/swiftace-org/swiftace](https://github.com/swiftace-org/swiftace).
