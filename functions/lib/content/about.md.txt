SwiftAce can be thought of as a “[Discourse](https://discourse.org/)/[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) for Online Courses” or an “Open-source [Teachable Alternative](https://alternativeto.net/software/teachable/).” SwiftAce is currently under active development and is **NOT** ready for alpha/beta/production use.

Development updates and release notes will be added on this page. To self-host SwiftAce, browse the source code, and follow the development, visit the GitHub repository: https://github.com/swiftace-org/swiftace.
